what is oop / do you know oop?

oop makes our code smaller by splitting it into classes, these classes contains attributes and methods as blueprint
that will create an object on instance.

FUNDAMENTALS

attributes //properties or variables
methods //behaviors or functions

you might have a class called Animal that defines attributes such as name and age, and methods like eat() and sleep().

ATTRIBUTES
in a class Person, attributes could include name, age, gender, etc.

METHODS
in a class Car, methods could include start(), accelerate(), brake(), etc.

OBJECTS
instances of classes.
They are created based on the structure defined by the class.
Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by the methods of its class.
if you have a class Book, you can create multiple book objects, each representing a different book with its own title, author, etc.

PRINCIPLES

INHERITANCE
in oop we implemented a parent-child classes, in which parent attributes and methods is passed to it's child classes.

ENCAPSULATION
is a way of exposing only selected information inside an object
and adds security.

ABSTRACTION
is an extention of encapsulation that uses classes and objects.
the attributes and methods is stored in an object that is being called to it's child classes.

POLYMORPHISM
designing objects to share behaviors. Using inheritance, objects can override shared parent behaviors with specific child behaviors.
different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.
